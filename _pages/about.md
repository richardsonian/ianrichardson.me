## Hello! Thanks for visiting my page.
My name is Ian, and I'm a current undergrad Electrical Engineer at Yale with a passion for tinkering, making, and DIY. This website serves a portfolio and devlog of my favorite personal project over the years. If you want to get in touch, see the contact page!

I started programming when I was 10 years old after relative gifted me a kids' book on Python (thank you [Warren and Carter Sande](https://www.manning.com/books/hello-world-third-edition)!) I immediately tore through it in a matter of weeks. I was fascinated by the process of getting computers to automate calculations and daily tasks, and started to imagine all the things I could do with my new-found skill.

Around the same time, I started building soldering kits at my local electronics store. I fell in love with all the classic build-your-own projectsâ€”from light sensing buzzer bugs to customizable LED banners.

I spent a few years begging my parents for soldering kits at every chance I had. Eventually I had built all the ones I could find, and started to think about making my own designs. I had high aspirations, like building my own wireless charger (back before they were commercially available!) and automatic hot-chocolate brewing machine. However as a middle-schooler I didn't have the circuit skills to wire-up much more than a few resistors and LEDs by myself.

I was introduced to Arduino in the summer of 2015 and immediately fell in love. Microcontrollers perfectly married my passions for programming and circuitry that, until then, had been kept separate.

### In 2015, I built my first self-designed project with Arduino.
It was the first prototype of the "FingerPass" project included on this page!

This marked the beginning of a lifetime passion for tinkering and DIY projects. As I grew older, I read more books, took classes, and tried new projects to push my skills. This website serves to document my progress and share my projects with the world!
