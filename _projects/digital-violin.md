## About this Project

Adaptive digital violin-like instrument based on BoseBuild Arduino learning kit. Gyroscope sensor in bow allows 2-axis rotation for control of notes, magnet sensor allows live control of volume. User settings for timbre, ASDR, key, and mode.

### Video Demo

In this video I play a major and minor scale using my digital violin-like instrument.
The instrument is triggered to play a note when the magnet taped to my finger approaches a magnetic sensor in the body of the violin. I use an accelerometer to determine the orientation of the wand, and have it play four different notes for each angle that the body creates. You can flip the wand over to get four more notes, making a complete scale.
Using a button and slider on the speaker cube, this instrument is massively configurable. You can change the Attack, Sustain, Decay, and Release of the notes, as well as the octave, key, and mode of the scale. In the middle of the video I move the slide to toggle from Major to minor.
