## About this Project

Watchface for Pebble Smartwatch and companion phone app that track my school schedule. Phone downloads schedule from online feed, and sends to watch once a day. Watch parses schedule, and lists current block, class, and remaining time in the period. Written in C and JavaScript.

My high school’s schedule is *really* confusing, with blocks that cycle through inconsistent time slots that aren’t the same week-to-week. So, I saved allowance money to buy the current cheapest smartwatch on the market—the Pebble Time— and set out to code a schedule tracking watchface for it. Being such a small company, Pebble’s developer support was horrible—I wrote the entire app dodging bugs in their API in barebones C, with almost no forums or documentation. It was a major challenge, but in the end, I came out much more comfortable in C, and with a useful tool that I could carry throughout my daily life.
