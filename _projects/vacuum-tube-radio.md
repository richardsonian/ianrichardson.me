## About this Project

### Inspiration

Amateur Radio has been a long-time passion of mine. I've been a licensed operator since 2014, and spent lots of time on the airâ€”from weather reporting nets to contact competitions (like [ARRL Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)). Having spent so much time around radios, it had been a long-term goal of mine to build one for myself.

This project was submitted as a final project for a course I took on Western Civilization. It represents the accomplishments of [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi) and other contemporary radio amateurs that pushed forward early radio technology after the turn of the 20th century. As a radio amatuer and tinkerer myself, I was inspired by this history of hobbyist engineers developing the technology that would come to be the foundation of our modern wireless lives. This radio transmitter is built in the style of these early hobbyist designs, using time accurate controls and (mostly) authentic analog and vacuum tube technology.

### The Design

This was one of my first large analog circuitry projects
