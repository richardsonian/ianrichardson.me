## About this Project

In 2016, I was inspired to create a headless server rig so that I could host a website, PC backups, and video game servers for my friends and me. Without enough money to buy new computer parts, I scoured through ebay and found an old 2006 dual CPU server motherboard that came with two medium tier Xeons and 16GB of DDR2 ram, all for $40. I bought a cheap power supply and hard drive, found some fans for free at a local electronics recycling site, and installed Ubuntu Server on the machine. At the time, I had absolutely no experience with GNU/linux, networking, or server management. So, running the rig spread out caseless on my basement table, and with a lot of trial and error, this server became my experimental way to become a proficient network administrator and linux user. Three years later (2020), now relying on the server for several programs (it hosted this very website for some time!), I was inspired to build a protective homebrew case out of scrap wood and acrylic for the rig, which you can see below.
